# Temporal-Modelling-of-Air-Pollution
Temporal modelling was performed using key parameters influencing the concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, and NOx pollutants.
The Pearson and Spearman coefficients were used to calculate the link and correlation between the parameters and pollutant concentrations.
In addition, the AR statistical model was utilised in this study to examine the autocorrelation of contaminants.
The research was continued by modelling in two phases, one without considering pollutant autocorrelation and the other with pollutant autocorrelation.
MLP and Random Forest approaches were employed for modelling in both cases.
